## v0.0.4

- Added decoding variant that uses `from:UnsafeRawPointer, size:size_t` as input.

## v0.0.3

- Updated `Package.swift` to reference C lib `yyjson` directly, since the `tannerdsilva/yyjson` fork was simply a mirror (a fork initially deemed necessary for managing release tags).

## v0.0.2

- Updated `Package.swift` to use SemVer range for `yyjson` instead of explicit revision hashes.

## v0.0.1

- First tag. Expecting a fairly stable experience, but more development is needed to really finish off the API surface.

- Basic tests to prove high-level functionality.

- Plentiful comments and consistent naming.

- MIT license.

- One dependency (`yyjson`, of course)
